    <h1>CATS</h1>
      <p>Thank you for taking care of these little weirdos. They appreciate it very much.</p>
    <h2>Who are cats?</h2>
      <h3>This is Paws</h2>

      <h3>This is Izzy</h2>

    <p>They are so happy you are here!></p>
    <p>The address is 2841 Harrison Street. It's a green building. Our apartment is on the first floor.</p>
    <h2>What do cats eat?</h2>
    <p>They eat once in the morning and once at night, but the exact time doesn't matter too much.<p>
    <h3>Izzy</h3>
    <p>She eats only dry food. Just fill her bowl up and let her eat as much as she wants. We put her bowl down by the metal kitchen cart. Shut the kitchen door when she’s eating so Paws doesn’t steal all her food. If you’re in a hurry, just leave her in the kitchen all day/night. If you feel like hanging out, give her like 15 minutes at least to eat, then you can open the door.</p>
    <h3>Paws</h3>
    <p>Paws eats raw food. It’s in the rectangular metal container in the fridge.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the food in the fridge is gone, just refill the container with more food from the freezer. It takes 12 hours or so to defrost, so fill it up as soon as it’s out so it’s ready for the next meal.</li>
      <li>Since it’s raw, it’s important to wash the bowls before you use them again. He has a metal bowl and little glass dishes that we’ll leave out.</li>
      <li>He gets 2 pellets in the morning and 2.5 at night.</li>
      <li>He’s ALWAYS hungry, so he eats in the bathroom (like a classy dude). Put his dish in the bathroom and close the door to the kitchen so Izzy can eat in peace. He might try to rush into the kitchen to get her food, so keep an eye on him. Also, if you leave ANY food out he will definitely eat it, so watch your snacks if you have any!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>The water bowl is in the kitchen, on the floor by the window. Just check that it's at least half full-ish.</p>
